## Quick start


It is not necessary to run any command, download the expo app and scan the project [QR code](https://expo.dev/@noroboto/vanhack-test-noroboto) (IOS / Android)

- ```yarn install```
- ```yarn start```

## History

Well, this was the journey of how I got to the final product.

Day 1: Mock of the app made in framer, it is essential to do it to have a guide of components to reuse, this product changed a little with respect to the final result.

In turn, the features were selected (in addition to what was proposed by the test).

Day 2: Design and architecture of the app: Theme, constants, Scaffolding, basic component with style variants, redux.

Day 3: Hands on features: Persistent store, bookmarks and UI for feed view.

Day 4: completed views and navigation, finished job card UI and redux actions with thunks.

Day 5: Finish detail view and video recording with preview.

## What's included

* Basic UI design.
* Typescript.
* Animations for some components (card)
* Onboarding flow.
* Persistent bookmarks and job applications, last but not least, onboarding persistent state.
* Video recording and vido preview.

## Bugs and code smells üêõ

Not everything is perfect, since this project is an assestment carried out outside working hours, time played an important role:

- No tests. 
- The logical navigation does not work at all well, bad UX.
- Some UI components are more affectionate than others: p.
- Some inconsistencies in the styles, the theme, typos, etc. are not reused. (I'm human).
